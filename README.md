#Calendari 

This project was done at Dragon Hacks 2016. The project was based on the idea of taking a picture 
and having the picture sort through information and upload it to your google calendar.
The idea came from walking around on campus and seeing the events but not having enough time to place the event 
in your calendar.

####So we figured why not take a picture and have Calendari take care of the work of reading the picture and uploading to it the your google calendar
